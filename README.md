1. [`Component`](https://github.com/SamZayd/react_proj/tree/master/Practice%20Files/Component) 
   Component - piece of code.
   
   If you build like components, we keep our code manageable. If we change the component, we will update that component only. We don't want to find the code of the entire webpage.

   And we also reuse components. Write code once and easily re-use no of times.

   Building the complex user interface using HTML, CSS, JS gives you more complexity.

2. [`Props`](https://github.com/SamZayd/react_proj/tree/master/Practice%20Files/Props)
   
   
3. [`State`](https://github.com/SamZayd/react_proj/tree/master/Practice%20Files/State)
