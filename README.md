### `RoadMap for react_proj`

In this directory you can find all the created apps program inside [Practice File](https://github.com/SamZayd/react_proj/tree/master/Practice%20Files).

1. #[**`Component`**](https://github.com/SamZayd/react_proj/tree/master/Practice%20Files/Component) 
   
   
   If you build like components, we keep our code manageable. If we change the component, we will update that component only. 
   We don't want to find the code of the entire webpage.

   And we also reuse components. Write code once and easily re-use no of times.

   
   → React - Components represent part of the UI.

   → In React everything is a component.

   → Whatever is visible on a web page or browser, all those things are components.

   → All these components are independent of one another. 
   
   → We can easily update or change any of these components without disturbing the rest of the application.

                                                         ## **React Component Types?**
      
      **_Functional Component_**                                                                       

         - Functional Components should return one and only element is JSX.                           

         - export Default <Component>                                                                
   
      **_Class Component_**                            
   
         - Should extends React.Component
   
         - minimum one method: render()
   
         - render () method should return one and only element i.e., JSX.
